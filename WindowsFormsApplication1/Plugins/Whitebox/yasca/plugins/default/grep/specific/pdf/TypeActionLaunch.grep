<p>
	The PDF specification allows for the automatic execution of external programs. Though the user
	is usually prompted before execution, social engineering can be used to entice a victim to allowing
	the program to be executed on their behalf.
</p>
<p>
	It is unlikely that a legitimate PDF file will be making /Launch calls to external programs. Please
	consider reviewing the raw contents of the PDF to determine if the call is legitimate.
