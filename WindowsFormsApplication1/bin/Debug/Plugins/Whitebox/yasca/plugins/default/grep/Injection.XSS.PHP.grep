	<p>
		Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to 
		impersonate or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.

		The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a victim to visit a URL
		with specially crafted JavaScript to perform actions on the site on behalf of the 
		attacker, or to simply steal the session cookie.
