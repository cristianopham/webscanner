<p>
	The realloc() function is used to reallocate memory that was previously
	in use. If memory is not explicitly cleared, the data that was originally
	at that location can be accessed by the program.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of usiing realloc(), use calloc() and move the memory contents
	yourself. You may wish to wrap this operation into a "safe" realloc()
	version.
