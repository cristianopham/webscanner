<p>
    The System.loadLibrary() function is dangerous because it brings a native executable (shared object or DLL) into the JVM. This library
	could potentially execute functions that that application wouldn't normally have access to. (Native executables are not bound by the JVM
	security restrictions.)

	Only load libraries from trusted sources.
