<p>
	Web servers generally show their component names and versions within the 'Server' header.
	This can make it easy for attackers to make targets of servers with known vulnerabilities.
	It is a best practice to remove this information on all production servers. Refer to your
	web-servers operating manual on instructions on how to do so.
